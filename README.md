# Simulation studies for studying the orientation of SNPs
This repository contains simulation and analysis codes for the paper 
"Potential problems with Egger regression in Mendelian randomization".

### Files description
* `main_simulation.R`: Summary-level simulations described in the main text, including Simulation (a) and (b) under both balanced and directional pleitropy.
* `indiv_TSLS_PMR.R`: Individual-level simulations described in Supplementary Section 2 and 3. 
* `weakIV_simulation.R`: Summary-level simulations with irrelevant IVs described in Supplementary Section 4.
* `mr_egger_func.R`: Perform MR-Egger with a specific coding scheme.
